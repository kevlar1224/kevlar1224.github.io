            <h3>IAP Application Rates by Race</h3>
            <div id='rate-chart'></div>
            <div class='p-container'>
                <p>The data on insurance affordability program (IAP) application rates 
                    in California was collected from 
                    <a href='https://data.chhs.ca.gov'>data.chhs.ca.gov</a> and aggregated
                    by user <a href='https://data.world/chhs'>@chhs</a> on data.world 
                    (<a href='https://data.world/chhs/7dea6bc2-5687-4b10-acbc-efb7a53aa65f'>by
                    race</a> and <a href='https://data.world/chhs/f20e3d31-13d3-44b1-a79f-c7bfab1c54a6'>
                    by ethnicity</a>). The data was taken from between 2016 and 2018.
                </p>
                <p>While one might think that inability to afford insurance might be an 
                    accurate indicator for poverty, the reality is more complicated. The graph
                    clearly shows that the data does not line up with the data for 
                    poverty rates. It makes sense that poverty is not enough of a determinant
                    for need for IAPs; difficulty affording insurance could also result from 
                    pre-existing conditions or genetic predisposition for various health issues. 
                </p>
                <p>Conversely, a racial group may be more capable of affording insurance due to 
                    less vulnerability to illnesses. Different racial groups may also be more or 
                    less inclines to apply for IAPs due to cultural values on healthcare or 
                    seeking assistance.
                </p>

            </div>

            <h3>IAP Application Count by Race</h3>
            <div id='pop-chart'></div>
            <div class='p-container'>
                <p>Again, the two dominant racial groups in terms of count are Hispanics 
                    and Whites, due to their large populations. Despite having the lowest
                    poverty rate, Whites had one of the highest rates of IAP application.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>IAP Application Rates by Age</h3>
            <div id='age-chart'></div>
            <div class='p-container'>
                <p>There is also data on 
                    <a href='https://data.world/chhs/2e8b0cd1-0caa-4066-9475-bc44cb171474'>
                    application rates by age</a>, again aggregated by user
                    <a href='https://data.chhs.ca.gov'>data.chhs.ca.gov</a>. It seems as 
                    people age, they become less likely to apply for IAPs, possibly as they 
                    become more established in their careers and more able to afford insurance 
                    on their own.
