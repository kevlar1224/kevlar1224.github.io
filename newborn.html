            <h3>Newborn Disease Rates by Race</h3>
            <div id='rate-chart'></div>
            <div class='p-container'>
                <p class='warning'>**Note: The dataset used for this page is no longer
                    available on data.world**
                </p>
                <p>As with other categories, Black Americans are the leader with 307.39
                    cases of newborn diseases per 100,000 live births (almost triple the
                    overall rate of 105.43 cases per 100,000 live births). 
                </p>
                <p>It is interesting to note that this chart looks quite different from the 
                    chart for infant mortality rates; particularly, mixed race infants have 
                    a very high rate of mortality, but a below-average rate of disorders. 
                    This indicates that, although disorders might reduce infant survivability, 
                    disorder rate is not a strong determinant of infant mortality.
                </p>
                <p>The dataset contained no records of disorders in Native Hawaiian/Pacific 
                    Islander newborns.

                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Newborn Disease Count by Race</h3>
            <div id='pop-chart'></div>
            <div class='p-container'>
                <p>Again, the two largest groups in terms of count are Hispanics and Whites,
                    the two largest populations in California. Black Americans, despite 
                    comprising a fairly small portion of the population, had the third most 
                    cases of newborn disorders.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Most Common Diseases By Race</h3>
            <div id='grouped-chart'></div>
            <div class='p-container'>
                <p>As the dataset contained the specific disorders that were found in newborns, 
                    we can see which disorders the different racial groups experienced. With 
                    all groups, a leading disorder was primary congenital hypothyroidism. 
                    However, it seems Black newborns experienced an incredibly high rate of 
                    sickle cell disease, which accounted for almost 90% of disorders found in 
                    Black newborns.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Disease Rate by Disease</h3>
            <div id='disease-chart'></div>
            <div class='p-container'>
                <p>Overall, the most prominent disorder was primary congenital hypothyroidism, 
                    with almost 1800 cases. Sickle cell disease was the second most prominent, 
                    with 566 cases, most of which were Black newborns (487 cases).
