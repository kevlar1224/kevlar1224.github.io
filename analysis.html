            <h3>Correlation Coefficient with Poverty Rate</h3>
            <div id='corr-chart'></div>
            <div class='p-container'>
                <p>To see how strongly the population statistics are determined by poverty, 
                    and vice versa, we can take each statistics' coefficient of correlation 
                    with poverty rate. This reveals only mild correlation with poverty rate, 
                    the highest coefficient being less than .6. So, although each of these 
                    statistics may be affected by poverty rate, all of them are influenced by 
                    additional factors. However, of all the factors, newborn disease rate is 
                    the most influenced by poverty rate.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Correlation Coefficients Between Factors</h3>
            <div id='inter-chart'></div>
            <div class='p-container'>
                <p>To examine further, we can find the correlation coefficients of each 
                    population statistic between each other. We see that most of these factors 
                    correlate with each other more than they do with poverty rate, with the 
                    exception of infant mortality rates with IAP application rates. Most of 
                    the coefficients are around .6, but one stands out at .972. The relation 
                    between HIV/AIDS infection rates and newborn disease rates is very linear.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Correlation Between HIV/AIDS and Newborn Diseases</h3>
            <div id='two-chart'></div>
            <div class='p-container'>
                <p>Using scikit-learn, we can create a linear regression model for the 
                    relationship between HIV/AIDS infection rates and newborn disease rates. 
                    The result is a line with a slope of approximately .274 and a y-intercept 
                    around 35.042. The model has an R-squared value of .9444, which is further  
                    evidence of a linear relationship. We can see, by plotting HIV/AIDS rates 
                    against newborn disease rates, that the data points all lie very close to 
                    the line generated by the model.
                </p>
                <p>The linear relationship between the two factors indicated that they either 
                    cause one another or have common underlying causes. It may be the case 
                    that HIV/AIDS infection may increase the risk of offspring developing 
                    newborn diseases (such as hypothyroidism). The two population statistics 
                    may also both be influenced by general health and health education.
                </p>
                <p>For both population statistics, Black Americans lead by a large margin, 
                    whereas with other statistics, they lead by a fairly narrow margin. 
                    Their being outliers in both may be a coincidence, as the high rate of 
                    sickle cell disease in Black newborns is genetic, while HIV/AIDS infection 
                    would be influenced by outward factors such as sexual activity and access 
                    to resources such as sex education and condoms.
